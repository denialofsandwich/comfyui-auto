ComfyUI docker image with some extras

My idea is to have a docker image, which contains everything I need to directly run it in runpod.io.
Theoretically it should run in other container hosts as well, since there is no runpod specific code involved.

If you want to run it yourself and make some modifications, you can just fork this repo,
make your changes and the included github action will build your modified image automatically if you create a release
